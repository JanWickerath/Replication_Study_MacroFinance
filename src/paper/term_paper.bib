The exchange rate of the deleveraging country will depreciate in the short run and appreciate in the
long run. The real interest rate will fall by more than in the rest of the world. Bounds and policies that
constrain the adjustment can prolong and deepen the recession. Early exit strategies from accommodating
monetary policy can be quite harmful, as can such other policies as keeping interest rates too high
during the deleveraging period. The analysis also applies to a monetary union facing internal adjustment
of current account imbalances.},

an additional dimension of policy alongside “conventional” interest
rate policy in a general-equilibrium model of asset pricing with
endogenous collateral constraints. The effects of asset purchases
depend on the way that they affect collateral constraints. We show
that under some circumstances, central bank purchases relax
financial constraints, increase aggregate demand, and may even
achieve a Pareto improvement; but in other cases, they tighten
financial constraints, reduce aggregate demand, and lower welfare.
The latter case is almost certainly the one that arises if central bank
purchases are sufficiently large.},

accelerator", in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and
propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the
model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate
money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions
may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in
investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics
and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the
data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers
have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of
the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle
dynamics.},

Private debt reflects equilibrium trade between an impatient borrower, who faces an endogenous collateral constraint, and a patient saver, who engages in consumption smoothing. Since inflation can positively affect borrower's net worth, monetary policy optimally balances the incentive to offset the price stickiness distortion with the one of marginally relaxing the borrower's collateral constraint. We find that the optimal volatility of inflation is increasing in three key parameters: (i) the borrower's weight in the planner's objective function; (ii) the borrower's impatience rate; (iii) the degree of price flexibility. In general, however, deviations from price stability are small for a small degree of price stickiness. In a two-sector version of our model, in which durable price movements can directly affect the ability of borrowing, the optimal volatility of (non-durable) inflation is more sizeable. In our context, and relative to simple Taylor rules, the Ramsey-optimal allocation entails a partial smoothing of real durable goods prices.},

	abstract = {Using a Bayesian likelihood approach, we estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the {US} economy using seven macroeconomic time series. The model incorporates many types of real and nominal frictions and seven types of structural shocks. We show that this model is able to compete with Bayesian Vector Autoregression models in out-of-sample prediction. We investigate the relative empirical importance of the various frictions. Finally, using the estimated model, we address a number of key issues in business cycle analysis: What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? Can the model explain the cross correlation between output and inflation? What are the effects of productivity on hours worked? What are the sources of the "Great Moderation"?

	abstract = {We develop a model of staggered prices along the lines of Phelps (1978) and Taylor (1979, 1980), but utilizing an analytically more tractable price-setting technology. ‘Demands’ are derived from utility maximization assuming Sidrauski-Brock infinitely-lived families. We show that the nature of the equilibrium path can be found out on the basis of essentially graphical techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of the model by analyzing the welfare implications of monetary and fiscal policy, and by showing that despite the price level being a predetermined variable, a policy of pegging the nominal interest rate will lead to the existence of a continuum of equilibria.},
