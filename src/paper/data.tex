\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Figure \ref{fig:figure1_update} shows quarterly data for equity payouts and
debt repurchases in the nonfinancial business sector from the first quarter of
1952 to the third quarter of 2015. Equity Payout is calculated as net
dividends of farm and nonfarm sector minus net increase in corporate equities
minus proprietorsâ€™ net investment and normalized by Business GDP times 10 (to
meet the scale in the paper). Debt Repurchase is the negative of net increase in
debt, normalized by Business GDP times 10. All the data were taken from the
December release of the ``Financial Accounts of the United States'', provided
by the board of governors of the federal reserve system. A detailed description
of the data sources can be found in section \ref{sub:data_sources} of the
Appendix.

The shaded grey areas in figure \ref{fig:figure1_update} indicate recessions as
defined by the National Bureau of economic research. The figure indicates that
in times of recessions equity payout typically decline, whereas debt
repurchases typically increase. Hence in times of economic distress firms
replace debt with equity. This behaviour is typically explained in the finance
literature by the ``pecking order hypothesis'' \parencite{myers_capital_1984} and to
model it is at the heart of paper by \textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012}.
