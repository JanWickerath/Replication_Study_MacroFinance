\section{Baseline model}
\label{sec:baseline_model}

The following section will shortly discuss the most important differences of
the baseline model in \textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012} to the canonical
real business cycle model. After that I will present how I created the shock
processes and discuss differences to the procedure from
\citeauthor{jerman_macroeconomic_2012}. I will then present a short comparison
of the model simulation to the observed data.


The baseline model differs from the canonical real business cycle model
primarily on the firm side of the economy. In this model firms have two sources
of financing: debt and equity. By assumption debt has a tax advantage over
equity and is therefore the preferred source of funding. A similar structure of
firm financing is proposed by \textcite{hennessy_debt_2005}. Firms are allowed
to default on their debt obligations and the decision to default arises
endogenously in the model. As a result the amount of debt a firm can hold will
be limited by the expected liquidation value of its physical capital. The
intuition behind this is that the physical capital will serve as collateral for
the loan. So if the firm decides to default on its debt obligations the lenders
will be able to liquidate the capital but cannot recover any funds from the
liquidity that the firm holds. Anticipating that the firm owner can ``run
away'' with the liquid assets, the lender will only give as much credit as he
can expect to recover in case of a default. The most important difference to
other papers that also study the effects of collateralization in macroeconomic
models (see e.g. \textcite{kiyotaki_credit_1997} and
\textcite{quadrini_financial_2011} for a summary) is the fact that the
liquidation value in \textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012} is stochastic. As a
result the financial friction in this model not only amplifies shocks that
originate in the real sector of the economy. The stochastic factor that
determines the liquidation value of physical capital can be interpreted as a
shock that originates in the financial sector.

\subsection{Shock construction}
\label{sec:shock_construction}

Capital is calculated as described in the online appendix:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:capital_original}
  k_{t+1} = k_t - \text{Depreciation} + \text{Investment},
  \end{equation}
where Depreciation is calculated as capital consumption of corporate and
noncorporate business, and investment is calculated as total capital
expenditure of nonfinancial business, both divided by the business price
index.

For Depreciation and Investment I use observations from first quarter of 1952
to the third quarter of 2015. As is done in the original calculation I chose an
initial value for capital such that there is no trend in the ratio of capital
to real business gdp over the period 1952Q1--2015Q3. With two digits precision
this leads to a initial capital stock equal to 22.53. This initial value
describes the capital stock at the beginning of the first period in the
observation sample. With this procedure I get a vector of capital stocks that
starts at the \textbf{beginning of 1952Q1} and ends at the \textbf{end of
  2015Q3}. I remove the initial capital stock from this vector so that the
vector of capital stocks has the same length as my other observed variables and
contains the end-of-period capital stocks from the first quarter of 1952 to the
third quarter of 1952.

Proportional deviations of capital are then obtained by taking the logarithm of
the capital series and linearly detrending it over the subperiod
1984Q1--2015Q2.

Debt levels are also calculated as described in the online appendix:
\begin{equation}
    b_{t+1}^e = b_t^e + \text{Net New Borrowing},
\end{equation}
where Net New Borrowing is taken from the debt securities and loans series for
nonfinancial business as described above. Note that \( b_{t+1} \) denotes the
debt level at the end of period \(t\).

The initial value for debt, i.e.\ the debt level that is around at the
\textbf{beginning of 1952Q1}, is chosen as in the original program
(94.12). Real debt levels are then computed by dividing debt levels from the
end of 1952Q1 to the end of 2015Q2 by the business price level of the same
period. Proportional deviations are again computed by linearly detrending the
logarithmic series for the period 1984Q1--2015Q2.

Real business gdp is calculated by dividing the series for business value added
by the business price index. Real gdp and the index for working hours are
already normalized. Proportional deviations for all these variables are
calculated as described above.

The index of aggregate working hours data that I use here are slightly
different then the ones used in the original paper. This might be due to a
different normalization of the index, or to data revisions. However, since the
description of how the data series for labor is constructed is not very precise
it is difficult to confirm where this differences come from.

The financial shocks \( \xi \) are constructed by linearizing the enforcement constraint:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fin_shock_correct_timing}
    \hat{\xi}_t = \phi_k \hat{k}_{t+1} + \phi_b \hat{b^e}_{t+1} + \hat{y}_t.
\end{equation}
This is equivalent to equation (1) in the online appendix. Here real business
gdp (defined above) is used for the variable \(\hat{y}_t\).

The productivity shocks are computed from the linearized production function:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{z}_t = \hat{y}_t - \theta \hat{k}_t - (1 - \theta) \hat{n}_t.
\end{equation}
Here, in contrast to the construction of financial shocks, real total gdp is
used for \(\hat{y}_t\). Note that I only have proportional deviations of
capital stocks for the end of period 1984Q1 onwards. Hence the vector of
productivity values ranges from the \textbf{second quarter of 1984 to the
  second quarter of 2015}. Since both shock vectors have to be of the same
length, I also only calculate the financial shocks for this time span.
