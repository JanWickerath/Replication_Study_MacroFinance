\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This term paper has shown how the main results from
\textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012} can be replicated and updated. It also
addressed and discussed some flaws and inconsistencies from the original
paper. The results show that the main results from
\textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012} remain unchanged in the light of new data
and the updated procedure. However, it has been shown that the baseline model
suffers from a high correlation in the estimated innovations to productivity
and financial conditions. Furthermore it has been shown that the original
results for the estimation of the extended model might not be reliable due
missing convergence of the estimated posterior distribution.
