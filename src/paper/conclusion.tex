\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This term paper has shown how the main results from
\textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012} can be replicated and updated. Some flaws
and inconsistencies from the original paper are also addressed and
discussed. The results show that the main results from
\textcite{jerman_macroeconomic_2012} remain unchanged in the light of new data
and the updated procedure. However, it has been shown that the baseline model
suffers from a high correlation in the estimated innovations to productivity
and financial conditions, which makes it hard to defend the original
interpretation of the shock processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that the
original results for the estimation of the extended model might not be reliable
due missing convergence of the estimated posterior distribution.
