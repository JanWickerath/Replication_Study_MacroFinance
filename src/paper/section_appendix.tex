	\begin{itemize}
		% \item http://www.bea.gov//national/nipaweb/DownSS2.asp, November 7, 2015.
		\item Contain data on National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA).
		\item The following list provides the table codes and descriptions in both data sets from section 1 that are relevant to the replication study:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 10106	Table 1.1.6. Real Gross Domestic Product, Chained Dollars
			\item 10304	Table 1.3.4. Price Indexes for Gross Value Added by Sector

	\end{itemize}

\item \texttt{recessiondates.mat}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Contains data on recession dates needed to replicate shaded areas in figure 1 from \cite{JERMANNfinancial}. The data was provided as part of the project module in econometrics and statistics in the winter semester 15/16 at the University of Bonn.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

As described in section \ref{sec:data}, certain codes for the FFA data have changed compared to \citeauthor{JERMANNfinancial}. Table \ref{table:identifiers} contains all relevant code changes.\footnote{For future reference, all changes are listed here: \href{http://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/fof/CodeChange.aspx}{http://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/fof/CodeChange.aspx}, January 30, 2016.}

\subsection{Shock Construction}
\label{sec:appendix_shock_construction}

Using the updated data from the FFA, NIPA and Current Employment Statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as correcting and adjusting the construction of shocks as described in section \ref{sec:shock_construction} yields the following estimates for matrix $A$:
\begin{center}
\[
    A=
      \begin{bmatrix}
    	\input{../../out/tables/table_matrix_a.txt}
      \end{bmatrix}
\]
\end{center}

The following figure is used in section \ref{sec:shock_construction} to examine the presence of residual autocorrelation:
