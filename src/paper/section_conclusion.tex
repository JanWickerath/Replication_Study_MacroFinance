\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper attempts to reproduce some of the main findings from the original paper by \citeauthor{JERMANNfinancial}. While many of the results can be approximated, the majority of the findings cannot be reproduced exactly. This is particularly true for the baseline model due to inconsistencies between the online appendix and the provided code. Thus, interpreting the verification of the correctness of the original results as the purpose of a replication, the paper by \citeauthor{JERMANNfinancial} is not replicable in the strict sense. Additionally, the high correlation of the residual series discussed in section \ref{sec:baseline_model} implies that the baseline model is misspecified. Furthermore, the issue of metastability in the estimation of the extended model raises questions to the robustness of the original results.
