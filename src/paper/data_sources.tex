In order to update the results from the paper I downloaded the following

The Business price index I use is normalized so that the average price level in
the year 2009 is equal to 100. Note that this normalization is different to the
dataseries that is used in the original paper. There, the business price index
is normalized for the year 2005. The index of aggregate weekly hours is
normalized to be equal to 100 in 2002.
