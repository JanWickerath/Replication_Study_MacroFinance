Manual Input
============

Documentation of the code in **manual_input**. The files in this directory differ from the ones in **final** in that they do not automatically process data created in the analysis step but they contain data, which was included manually in the files themselves.

:file:`table_code_changes.tex`:

	.. include:: ../manual_input/table_code_changes.tex
	   :start-after: %{
	   :end-before: %}
