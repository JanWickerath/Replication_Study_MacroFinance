Introduction

The project is built using the Project templates provided by Hans-Martin von
Gaudecker at https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates. A general
introduction to the project-build system waf and the design of the templates
can be found at http://hmgaudecker.github.io/econ-project-templates/.

For running the entire project with waf, proceed as outlined in the README.md file contained in the main directory.

To make the scripts executable in the Matlab IDE, alternative path settings are included at the beginning of each script.

This project was built using Matlab R2014b and Dynare 4.4.3.
